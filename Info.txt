1) Code
1.1) All Helper/Repetitive Methods are at the bottom of Game Class 
- organized by sections and with detailed names
1.2) Wanted to Split the helper methods into Services (characterSelectService and inGameService)
but could not do it in time

2) GitHub
2.1 - Wish I posted the code earlier to GitHub so you can see more of the changes while they were being made

3) Game ideas (not implemented because I wanted to stick to the requirements)
3.1 - thought of replacing enemy monster symbol '◙' with each monster's unique Id on the playing grid
- so you have an idea exactly which monster is closest to you and you can attack it
3.2 - thought of having a turn counter (2,3,4) for when monsters spawn (currently spawning every turn)
- so you don't get overwhelmed so fast and can play for longer
3.3 - thought of bonus perks spawning on the map
- double damage, health pack, invulnerability, etc...
